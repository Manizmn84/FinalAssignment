# Repository Purpose

The purpose of creating this repository was that instead of trying to convert our latex codes to PDF from the Orleaf site, we could do this with the Actions section of the GitHub site.

There are two ways to do this: one with **tags** and one with a **push operation**, which was not tagged in my system and I had to proceed with a push. In the following, I explained how to do this step by step.

## How to Use


1. Create a repository.
2. Clone it to your machine.
3. Add your LaTeX file to the repository.
4. Modify the `main.yml` file to be able to compile your LaTeX file.
5. Push new files or change.
6. After the workflow, your LaTeX file will be released in the "Release" section.
7. After any changes, follow the steps starting from number 5.
